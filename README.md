# VisualizeFourierSeries

Complex functions are two dimensional in the sense that they have both a real and an imiginary part. Complex functions may therefore be used to draw images in the complex plane. This application lets the user draw an image (which can be thought of as a complex function) and then approximates the complex function described by the image using a complex fourier series. In the same way a real valued function can be approximated by sinusoids with different frequencies, a complex valued function can be approximated by complex exponentials with different frequencies. These complex exponentials describe a circle in the complex plane ...
