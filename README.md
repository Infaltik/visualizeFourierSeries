# VisualizeFourierSeries

Complex functions are two dimensional in the sense that they have both a real and an imaginary part. Complex functions may therefore be used to draw images in the complex plane since the real and imaginary parts can represent the x- and y-coordinates respectively of the drawn image. This application lets the user draw an image (which can be thought of as a complex function) and then approximates the complex function described by the image using a complex fourier series. In the same way a real valued function can be approximated by sinusoids with different frequencies, a complex valued function can be approximated by complex exponentials with different frequencies. These complex exponentials can be visualized as rotating vectors and since the complex fourier series is a sum of these complex exponentials the complex fourier series may also be visualized.
